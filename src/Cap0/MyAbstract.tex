\textbf{Abstract ---} 
In software development according to the Agile philosophy, consumer satisfaction is the priority. Therefore, the continuous delivery of functional software, compliant with the requirements in reliable formats, supports this technique of project management.\\ 

\hspace{1cm}Once the focus of quality assurance meets the assumptions of the principles of the Agile manifesto, implementing a pipeline of continuous integration and continuous delivery is one of the possible solutions to answer the needs felt by the organizations to constantly adapt to market changes. In most of the cases, these practices are verified to improve resilience.\\ 

\hspace{1cm}The existence of a continuous delivery pipeline brings much benefit since it supports the existence of an ecosystem with a version control system, a process orchestrator that coordinates a continuous integration tool that performs static analyzes, unit tests and integration tests. In another stage, a state transition system updates the phases of the projects from the testing phase, to staging, pre-live and live. All these tools and automations combined have the purpose of supporting high quality software development, the optimization of the development process and, whenever problems occur, support decision makers to improve their response.\\

\textbf{Keywords:} Quality assurance, Continuous integration, Continuous delivery, DevOps, Project Management, Agile.
